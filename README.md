This project basically focusses on the modern approach to analyses the performance of different
elected candidates in their tenure to provide a clean picture to the general public about their work.
This was a step towards the smart city campaign as we are using technology as a means to create
smart outcomes for citizens.

approaches are also used in the app to nullify the effect is someone tries to log redundant
complaints.
