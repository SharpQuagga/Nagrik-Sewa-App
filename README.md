# Nagrik Sewa App

This project basically focusses on the modern approach to analyses the performance of different
elected candidates in their tenure to provide a clean picture to the general public about their work.
This was a step towards the smart city campaign as we are using technology as a means to create
smart outcomes for citizens.
This app takes use of Deep Learning frameworks in order to remove false complaints. Different
approaches are also used in the app to nullify the effect is someone tries to log redundant
complaints.
A ward wise graph and complaint graph over the years will be available to the user that will give
a clear indication as to how that particular ward has performed over the years.
A graph-based analysis comparing different wards to the city would give a clear indication as to
where a particular ward is stands. This is general public in becoming more aware help them to
choose the right candidate for themselves.
